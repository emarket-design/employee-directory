**Employee Directory comes with 3 editions - [See differences](https://emdplugins.com/plugin-pricing/employee-directory-wordpress-plugin-pricing/?pk_campaign=empd-com-readme)**

Employee Directory is an enterprise grade application primarily used in company intranets or extranets.

To support relatively and increasingly more complex and advanced requirements, Employee Directory comes with 3 editions; Starter, Professional and Enterprise.

Starter Edition is designed for small organizations and provides basic but fully functional company directory.

Starter edition allows to:

* Create and display Employee profile pages
* Search employees based on major attributes

The pricing of Employee Directory premium editions are based on the number of users an organization has. Premium editions have more features and offer dedicated account manager, on-boarding team and access to our Enterprise support.

*We recommend you to ask your client organization to contact us directly if you're a designer or developer and would like to purchase Employee Directory usage license*.

Enterprise and Professional Editions are designed for small to large organizations. Enterprise edition includes all available features. The main difference between Professional and Enterprise editions is workflows.

Workflows are used to automate resource intensive, repetitive tasks to save valuable staff member time and eliminate human errors. Workflows can be run on demand or a scheduled basis.

There are two types of workflows; Time (Schedulers) and Event (Triggers) based workflows. Schedulers can be used to send reminders, invitations, customized communications such as new hires, birthdays and employment anniversaries notifications etc.

Triggers are used to modify records or send customized when certain employee fields are changed or created. For example, you can send a customized emails when an employee gets promoted, completes a training, earns a certificate or showcased in a publication or media.
